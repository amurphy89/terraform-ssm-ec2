# Terraform SSM EC2

I regularly need to spin up an EC2 instance with SSM enabled for testing and debugging. I created this repo so you can also quickly spin up a test box on demand and easily destroy it when you are done!

## Features to be added

- Docker to be installed on the box so standing a website up is quick and easy
- Option for a public LB so you can host sites
- Remote backend
