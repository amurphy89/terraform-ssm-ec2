# Terraform SSM EC2

I regularly need to spin up an EC2 instance with SSM enabled for testing and debugging. I created this repo so you can also quickly spin up a test box on demand and easily destroy it when you are done! In future I will add a public LB and Docker on the box so that it can be used for standing a website up quickly.
